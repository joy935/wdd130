                    <h2>When Breath Becomes Air by Paul Kalanithi - 5/5 stars</h2>
                    <p>
                        In his memoir, Paul Kalanithi explores the profound questions of life, death, and meaning. He was a neurosurgeon diagnosed with terminal lung cancer and he  shares his personal journey as he fights with his own mortality. 
                    </p>
                    <p>

                    <h2>I'm Glad My Mom Died by Jennette McCurdy - 2/5 stars</h2>
                    <p>
                        Jennette McCurdy offers a poignant memoir in which she reflects on her struggles as a child actor, her eating disorder and mental health issues mainly due to an insufferable, cruel and narcissistic mother and absent father. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The memoir is intimate and offers a vulnerable look into McCurdy personal journey. While the book explores themes of loss and healing, some readers may find the writing style overly self-indulgent and lacking in depth. Additionally, the title may be misleading, as the book focuses more on the author's own experiences rather than an exploration of her mother's death. Despite its emotional moments, the book falls short of delivering a fully satisfying narrative.

                    <h2>From the Ashes by Jesse Thistle - 5/5 stars</h2>
                    <p>
                        "From the Ashes" is a powerful memoir that chronicles the author's journey from his unstable and fierce childhood with an absent mother, a drug-addict father and unloving grand-parentsa, his life of homelessness, addiction, and incarceration to becoming an accomplished scholar and advocate. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As Thistle recounts his struggles and battles we also dig into the rich Indigenous history and culture that shaped his identity. This deeply personal and inspiring narrative showcases resilience, redemption, and the transformative power of education to rise above the ashes.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The author is truthful and honest in his recount as he is open about his alcoholism, his violence at home and in the rink and his controversial other choices.

                        With a mix of historical analysis and speculative predictions, he challenges readers to consider the ethical and social implications of these advancements.
