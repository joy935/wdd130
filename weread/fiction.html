                    <h2>Bad Cree by Jessica Johns - 4/5 stars</h2>
                    <p>
                        Mackenzie is haunted by terrifying nightmares. She feels guilty about her sister Sabrina's death. As she starts to feel threatened she decides to go back home to the rural Alberta. Mackenzie finds comfort and support with her mother, other sister, cousin and auties.

                        "Bad Cree" is a compelling collection of interconnected short stories that explores the experiences of Indigenous characters, particularly those from the Cree community. The horror novel explores identity, relationships and the complexity of contemporary Indegenious life. It was refreshing and thought-provoking to get an authentic portrayal of Indegenious experiences facing death and loss, especially when the story is based on a strong female circle.

                    <h2>Daughter of the Moon Goddess by Sue Lynn Tan - 4/5 stars</h2>
                    <p>
                        Xingyin grew up on the moon, lonely and bored. When the Celestial Emperor comes to visit her mother, she realized how her existence has been hidden to protect her. She is forced to flee and leave her mother behind. Determined to save her mother, she embarks on multiple quests. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        "Daughter of the Moon Goddess" is a captivating fantasy novel set in a world inspired by Chinese mythology. It added depth and authenticity to the story, making the novel a delightful read for fans of fantasy and folklore. However, the love story unnecessarily alleviated the strenght and ambition of the female protagonist.

                    <h2>Less is Lost by Andrew Sean Greer - 2/4 stars</h2>
                    <p>
                        Arthur Less is afraid of turning fifty, his recent novel got rejected and his long-time lover, Freddy, left him. He decides to tour the world to escape this nightmare and avoid facing some enormous changes in his life. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        "Less is Lost" is funny and clever at times but redundant and quite snarky. There is a lack of character development in Less. While the book has been praised for its wit and humor, some readers may find the narrative meandering and disjointed, struggling to connect with the protagonist, a white and privileged man, or find a clear direction in the story. Despite its occasional moments of charm, "Less is Lost" falls short in delivering a fully engaging and satisfying reading experience.

                    <h2>Klara and the Sun by Kazuo Ishiguro - 4/5 stars</h2>
                    <p>
                        Klara is an "Artificial Friend"(AF). The novel follows her as she stands in the store waiting to be purchased and then when she is finally adopted by Josie.

                    <p>
                        "Klara and the Sun" presents a unique and contemplative story set in a future. It was interesting to observes the world through the Klara's innocent and curious eyes. While exploring themes of humanity, love, friendship, hope and consciousness, the slow pace and introspective nature of the narrative may prove challenging for some readers, requiring patience to fully appreciate its subtleties.

                    <h2>Everyone in My Family Has Killed Someone by Benjamin Stevenson - 2/5 stars</h2>
                    <p>
                        Earnest Cunningham helped his brother Matthew to hide a corpse. Tormented by this crime, he decided to tell the police what his brother has done. Three years later, all the family get together in the snowy mountains to reunite with Matthew since he's leaving jail. Following the gathering, a mysterious body is found in the snow. The reunion goes around to solve this mystery.

                    <p>
                        "Everyone in My Family Has Killed Someone" by Benjamin Stevenson is a crime thriller that explores the dark secrets lurking within a dysfunctional family. At first, the quirky tone and dark humour is pleasing and entertaining but it soon becomes irritating. The style of the writing doesn't resonate with some readers, as it is lacking in depth and fails to connect with the characters.
