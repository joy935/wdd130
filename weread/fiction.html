                    <h2>Bad Cree by Jessica Johns - 4/5 stars</h2>
                    <p>
                        Mackenzie is haunted by terrifying nightmares. She feels guilty about her sister Sabrina's death. As she starts to feel threatened she decides to go back home to the rural Alberta. Mackenzie finds comfort and support with her mother, other sister, cousin and auties.

                        "Bad Cree" is a compelling collection of interconnected short stories that explores the experiences of Indigenous characters, particularly those from the Cree community. The horror novel explores identity, relationships and the complexity of contemporary Indegenious life. It was refreshing and thought-provoking to get an authentic portrayal of Indegenious experiences facing death and loss, especially when the story is based on a strong female circle.

                    <h2>Daughter of the Moon Goddess by Sue Lynn Tan - 4/5 stars</h2>
                    <p>
                        Xingyin grew up on the moon, lonely and bored. When the Celestial Emperor comes to visit her mother, she realized how her existence has been hidden to protect her. She is forced to flee and leave her mother behind. Determined to save her mother, she embarks on multiple quests.

                    <p>
                        "Daughter of the Moon Goddess" is a captivating fantasy novel set in a world inspired by Chinese mythology. It added depth and authenticity to the story, making the novel a delightful read for fans of fantasy and folklore. However, the love story unnecessarily alleviated the strenght and ambition of the female protagonist.

                    <h2>Less is Lost by Andrew Sean Greer - 2/4 stars</h2>
                    <p>
                        Arthur Less is afraid of turning fifty, his recent novel got rejected and his long-time lover, Freddy, left him. He decides to tour the world to escape this nightmare and avoid facing some enormous changes in his life. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        "Less is Lost" is funny and clever at times but redundant and quite snarky. There is a lack of character development in Less. While the book has been praised for its wit and humor, some readers may find the narrative meandering and disjointed, struggling to connect with the protagonist, a white and privileged man, or find a clear direction in the story. Despite its occasional moments of charm, "Less is Lost" falls short in delivering a fully engaging and satisfying reading experience.
