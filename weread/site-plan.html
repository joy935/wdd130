      <h3>Fiction</h3>
      <h4>Bad Cree by Jessica Johns - 4/5 stars</h4>
      <p>
        Mackenzie is haunted by terrifying nightmares. She feels guilty about her sister Sabrina's death. As she starts to feel threatened she decides to go back home to the rural Alberta. Mackenzie finds comfort and support with her mother, other sister, cousin and auties. 
        "Bad Cree" is a compelling collection of interconnected short stories that explores the experiences of Indigenous characters, particularly those from the Cree community. The horror novel explores identity, relationships and the complexity of contemporary Indegenious life. It was refreshing and thought-provoking to get an authentic portrayal of Indegenious experiences facing death and loss, especially when the story is based on a strong female circle.
      </p>

      <h4>Daughter of the Moon Goddess by Sue Lynn Tan - 4/5 stars</h4>
      <p>
        Xingyin grew up on the moon, lonely and bored. When the Celestial Emperor comes to visit her mother, she realized how her existence has been hidden to protect her. She is forced to flee and leave her mother behind. Determined to save her mother, she embarks on multiple quests. 
        "Daughter of the Moon Goddess" is a captivating fantasy novel set in a world inspired by Chinese mythology. It added depth and authenticity to the story, making the novel a delightful read for fans of fantasy and folklore. However, the love story unnecessarily alleviated the strenght and ambition of the female protagonist.  
      </p>
      <h4>Less is Lost by Andrew Sean Greer - 2/4 stars</h4>
      <p>
        Arthur Less is afraid of turning fifty, his recent novel got rejected and his long-time lover, Freddy, left him. He decides to tour the world to escape this nightmare and avoid facing some enormous changes in his life. 
        "Less is Lost" is funny and clever at times but redundant and quite snarky. There is a lack of character development in Less. While the book has been praised for its wit and humor, some readers may find the narrative meandering and disjointed, struggling to connect with the protagonist, a white and privileged man, or find a clear direction in the story. Despite its occasional moments of charm, "Less is Lost" falls short in delivering a fully engaging and satisfying reading experience.
      </p>
      <h4>Klara and the Sun by Kazuo Ishiguro - 4/5 stars</h4>
      <p>
        Klara is an "Artificial Friend"(AF). The novel follows her as she stands in the store waiting to be purchased and then when she is finally adopted by Josie. 
        "Klara and the Sun" presents a unique and contemplative story set in a future. It was interesting to observes the world through the Klara's innocent and curious eyes. While exploring themes of humanity, love, friendship, hope and consciousness, the slow pace and introspective nature of the narrative may prove challenging for some readers, requiring patience to fully appreciate its subtleties.
      </p>
      <h4>Everyone in My Family Has Killed Someone by Benjamin Stevenson - 2/5 stars</h4>
      <p>
        Earnest Cunningham helped his brother Matthew to hide a corpse. Tormented by this crime, he decided to tell the police what his brother has done. Three years later, all the family get together in the snowy mountains to reunite with Matthew since he's leaving jail. Following the gathering, a mysterious body is found in the snow. The reunion goes around to solve this mystery.
        "Everyone in My Family Has Killed Someone" by Benjamin Stevenson is a crime thriller that explores the dark secrets lurking within a dysfunctional family. At first, the quirky tone and dark humour is pleasing and entertaining but it soon becomes irritating. The style of the writing doesn't resonate with some readers, as it is lacking in depth and fails to connect with the characters.
      </p>
      <h4>Naruto by Masashi Kishimoto - Next Month Pick</h4>
      <p>
        In the vast domain of literary works, the significance of manga cannot be overlooked. Naruto, a beloved manga series by Masashi Kishimoto, transcends its pages to become a cultural phenomenon that has been captivating readers all around the world. With its blend of action, emotion, and intricate storytelling, Naruto has garnered a massive following and influenced generations of readers.
        While some may argue that manga falls outside the traditional realm of books, We Read has found crucial to recognize its immense literary value. Stay tuned to read our review on the first few books of Naruto!

      <h3>Nonfiction</h3>
      <h4>When Breath Becomes Air by Paul Kalanithi - 5/5 stars</h4>
      <p>
        In his memoir, Paul Kalanithi explores the profound questions of life, death, and meaning. He was a neurosurgeon diagnosed with terminal lung cancer and he  shares his personal journey as he fights with his own mortality. 
        The book offers a raw and introspective account of his experiences and reflections, providing readers with a poignant and thought-provoking exploration of life's fragility and the pursuit of purpose. His take on the meaning of life is moving and thought-provoking. 
      </p>
      <h4>I'm Glad My Mom Died by Jennette McCurdy - 2/5 stars</h4>
      <p>
        Jennette McCurdy offers a poignant memoir in which she reflects on her struggles as a child actor, her eating disorder and mental health issues mainly due to an insufferable, cruel and narcissistic mother and absent father. 
        The memoir is intimate and offers a vulnerable look into McCurdy personal journey. While the book explores themes of loss and healing, some readers may find the writing style overly self-indulgent and lacking in depth. Additionally, the title may be misleading, as the book focuses more on the author's own experiences rather than an exploration of her mother's death. Despite its emotional moments, the book falls short of delivering a fully satisfying narrative.
      </p>
      <h4>From the Ashes by Jesse Thistle - 5/5 stars </h4>
      <p>
        "From the Ashes" is a powerful memoir that chronicles the author's journey from his unstable and fierce childhood with an absent mother, a drug-addict father and unloving grand-parentsa, his life of homelessness, addiction, and incarceration to becoming an accomplished scholar and advocate. As Thistle recounts his struggles and battles we also dig into the rich Indigenous history and culture that shaped his identity. This deeply personal and inspiring narrative showcases resilience, redemption, and the transformative power of education to rise above the ashes.
      </p>
      <h4>Call Me Indian by Fred Sasakamoose - 5/5 stars</h4>
      <p>
        Fred Sasakamoose wrote a compelling autobiography that narrates his early life in the reserve to the residential school of St Michaels, to become the first Indigenous National Hockey League player and later the chief at Sandy Lake Sasakamoose shares his experiences of growing up in a remote Cree community, overcoming adversity, and his groundbreaking journey as a pioneering athlete. The author is truthful and honest in his recount as he is open about his alcoholism, his violence at home and in the rink and his controversial other choices. While shedding light on the challenges faced by Indigenous peoples in Canada, the book also celebrates resilience and determination. 
      </p>
      <h4>Homo Deus by Yuval Harari - 5/5 stars</h4>
      <p>
        "Homo Deus" is a thought-provoking exploration of humanity's future and the potential directions our species may take. Building upon the themes introduced in his previous book, "Sapiens," Harari dives into the possibilities of artificial intelligence, genetic engineering, and immortality. With a mix of historical analysis and speculative predictions, he challenges readers to consider the ethical and social implications of these advancements. Harari's engaging writing style and insightful observations make "Homo Deus" a captivating and intellectually stimulating read.
